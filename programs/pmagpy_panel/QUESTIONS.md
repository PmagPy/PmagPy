# Questions for Nick

Decisions I made on my own while building the hub, and questions I could not
settle from the code or the plan. Each entry says what I did in the meantime so
nothing is blocked; change the answer and I will change the code. Newest at
the bottom; struck through once settled.

## Upload page (2026-09-01)

1. **Where the upload file goes.** Pmag GUI wrote `<location>_<date>.txt` into
   the study directory and I kept that (Home's inventory recognises it, so it
   is not mistaken for a lab file). A 7 MB duplicate of the tables sitting
   beside them is untidy, though, and a second build adds `_1`, `_2` …
   *Alternative*: an `upload/` subfolder, or overwrite one `upload.txt`.
   Keep the Pmag GUI convention?

2. **Private workspace upload.** The four private-workspace functions
   (`create_private_contribution`, `upload_to_private_contribution`,
   `validate_contribution`, `delete_private_contribution`) take an EarthRef
   `username`/`password` and send them as HTTP basic auth. The page currently
   ends with a link to https://www2.earthref.org/MagIC/upload and leaves the
   last step to the browser. Is an in-app login worth building (a password
   field in a Panel page, the credential held in the server process), or is
   the hand-off fine? Also worth asking Rupert Minnett
   whether the public validate endpoint's current behaviour (≈70 s for a 7 MB
   file, the whole file in one POST) is something MagIC is happy to see from
   the hub.

3. **Offline validator vs MagIC's.** The bundled data model is the 2019 copy;
   MagIC's validator finds 33 problems on McMurdo where PmagPy's finds 2
   (mostly method codes and vocabularies that have moved on). Options: (a)
   refresh the bundled JSON on each release; (b) fetch the current data model
   at start-up when online and cache it; (c) drop the offline check and rely
   on the endpoint. I lean to (b) with (a) as the fallback. Which?

4. **Publication tables.** `ipmag.sites_extract` etc. now write into
   `publication_tables/` as `.xlsx` (or `.tsv` when openpyxl is missing) or
   LaTeX. Should openpyxl become a dependency of the apps environment? And are
   the column sets in `map_magic.convert_site_dm3_table_*` (TC, Dec, Inc, N,
   k, R, α95, VGP lat/lon; B, σ, N, VADM, VDM) still the tables people want in
   a paper, or should the page let the analyst choose columns?

5. **Upload file column policy.** `upload_magic` drops columns the data model
   does not know and folds declinations into 0–360. It says nothing about
   what it dropped. Should the page list the dropped columns (e.g. a lab's
   `notes_internal`) so the analyst knows what MagIC will not receive?

## Metadata page (2026-09-01)

6. **Age propagation.** ErMagicBuilder pushed a location-level age down to
   sites lacking one. The Metadata page does not (it fills coordinates and
   copies parent values on request). Is one-way propagation location → site
   → sample wanted, and should it write `age`/`age_unit` or an `ages.txt` row?

7. **Criteria table.** Pmag GUI edited `criteria.txt` in ErMagicBuilder with
   the selection criteria dialog. The hub has nothing for criteria yet; the
   Directions app writes its own. Where should criteria editing live — on
   Metadata as a sixth table, in each analysis app, or nowhere?
