find_EI problems:
        $ find_EI.py -f find_EI_example.dat
        works
        python Bootstrap.py -r find_EI.py
        works
        so.... no problem?

magic_select.py
        fixed


curie.py
        fixed
        added sys.exit()

lnp_magic.py
        added missing parentheses 
        fixed, but you still have a problem:
        I just realized a problem is that I can only test the installed pythonpath version of Pmag.py.  This may have been a mistake.  it might have been better to test it locally.  oh fuck.  

something_with_magic_keys.py
        fixed test

igrf.py

        subtly changed output
        someone else must debug

tdt_magic.py
        can no longer test because a gui window pops up and breaks it

HUJI_magic.py

        certain variables are only set given a particular flag, but then referenced either way.  is this a problem for actual use, or just testing?

specimen_results_magic.py
        
        new output column was added

IODP_csv_magic
        
        new output column was added



package-a-fy pmagpy so you can call tests
             angle.py test works!
             stuck on combine_magic test.  possibly take test_file_prefix out of __init__ and just have it in the actual functions.  in a way, this seems repetitive, but it drastically improved clarity for someone tinkering.
